**Project Description:**

The app allows users to make phone calls and receive real-time transcriptions of their conversations.

**Technologies & Architecture:**

The application was built using UIKit and SWIFTUI for the iOS platform. I implemented MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture to separate concerns and ensure maintainable code. The ViewModel handles data retrieval and transformation, while the View is responsible for displaying the UI.

**Unit Testing:**

To ensure the app's reliability, I wrote unit tests using XCTest. These tests helped ensure that the app behaves as expected in various scenarios, improving its stability and performance.![Simulator Screen Shot - iPhone 14 - 2024-11-25 at 23 03 28](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/373b8ca2-e3d8-4bcd-9264-c146f06377df)
